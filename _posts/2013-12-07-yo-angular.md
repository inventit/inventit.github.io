title: "Yeoman AngularJS Generator Tips"

I'm now trying to re-write a browser app with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), which one of my colleagues introduced to me as a cool stuff. Prior to the development, I'm strugging with creating an initial development environment. I found issues and resolutions through the set up and I describe them as follows.

## Software and version

    yeoman            ... 1.0.4
	generator-angular ... 0.6.0
	(Running on OSX 10.8.5)

## Installation

### Yeoman

    npm install -g yo

![yeoman](/img/posts/2013-12-07-yo-angular/yeoman.png)

### Yeoman Generator for AngularJS

    npm install -g generator-angular

### Creating app dir and run generator
(same as readme.md at https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)

    mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
    yo angular [app-name]

### Installing more utilities with npm
I had to install `bower` and `grunt-cli` manually since I'd had never installed them.

    npm install -g bower
	npm install -g grunt-cli

`karma` is required as well since the generated `Gruntfile.js` requires `karma` for js unit testing.

    npm install karma --save-dev
Note that `-g` is not required. The module must be installed locally ratehr than globally. An error occurs when running grunt when locally installed `karma` module is missing.

Adding a dependency on `karma` into the generated `package.json` seems to be a better workaround so that other developers are able to share the valid dependency info, i.e.:

	"devDependencies": {
		-- snip --
	  "grunt-karma": "~0.6.2",
	  "karma": "~0.10.8"
	},
	-- snip --

### Additional Karma configuration
As described above, the generated `Gruntfile.js` requires `karma` for js unit testing. However, `karma.conf.js` is missing, never generated. So you need to create it manually. You can copy it from [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/blob/master/config/karma.conf.js), an AngularJS skelton project. The file must be placed the same directory as the generated application root where `Gruntfile.js`/`bower.json`/`package.json` exist.

In addtion, you need to modify the copied file. Let's see where you need to modify.

#### basePath
Change the `basePath` from `../` to `.` as follows;

    basePath : '../',
to

    basePath : '.',

#### files and excludes
You need to replace `files` and `excludes` entries with the following stuff:

	files : [
	  'app/bower_components/angular/angular.js',
	  'app/bower_components/angular-cookies/angular-cookies.js',
	  'app/bower_components/angular-mocks/angular-mocks.js',
	  'app/bower_components/angular-resource/angular-resource.js',
	  'app/bower_components/angular-route/angular-route.js',
	  'app/bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.js',
	  'app/bower_components/es5-shim/es5-sham.js',
	  'app/bower_components/es5-shim/es5-shim.js',
	  'app/bower_components/json3/lib/json3.js',
	  'app/scripts/**/*.js',
	  'test/spec/**/*.js'
	],

	exclude : [
	],

#### plugins
As described in the `karma.conf.js`, there are some required plugins. You can install them by:

	npm install karma-junit-reporter --save-dev
	npm install karma-chrome-launcher --save-dev
	npm install karma-firefox-launcher --save-dev
	npm install karma-jasmine --save-dev

### Installing components with bower
In order to install view components, you need to run:

    bower install

You will see a blank page without running the command when previewing the app by `grunt serve`.

## SCM integration tips

### node_modules directory
As you can see if you take a look at the generated `.gitignore` file, `node_modules` directory cannot be committed. Other developers sharing the application project have to install dependent packages by running `npm install` after cloning the repository source codes.

### bower_components
As descrived above, `bower install` is required as `bower_components` is never shared by SCM as well as `node_modules`.
