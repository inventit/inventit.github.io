        <h1>Introduction to our Platform</h1>
        <p>Inventit ServiceSync is the most comprehensive IoT/M2M cloud platform on the market, allowing system integrators and solution providers to leverage a complete IoT/M2M application infrastructure to develop, deploy, and operate powerful IoT/M2M applications.</p>
        <p>These applications drive new revenue generating business models, significantly reduce existing service support costs, and improve service level agreements.</p>
        <p><strong>IoT/M2M solution providers and system integrators</strong> use the ServiceSync Service Portal built on ServiceSync Server, the Client, and Gateway to dramatically simplify the application development, eliminate the IoT/M2M infrastructure development, shorten time to market, and reduce operations and support costs of your IoT/M2M application.</p>
        <p>As illustrated in the diagram below, the ServiceSync Platform offers customers unique IoT/M2M application's run-time environment as well as device management capabilities, communicating directly with devices or through gateways/routers in the field through the ServiceSync Client and ServiceSync Gateway.  ServiceSync Platform also includes IoT/M2M application development tools for embedded and server to expedite time to market. These tools are coupled to the Client/Gateway and the services platform in order to create a comprehensive IoT/M2M development environment, which includes IoT/M2M asset modeling tools.</p>

        <h3>ServiceSync Platform</h3>
        <p>The core of ServiceSync Platform is a scalable and secure Services Platform with a web services interface from which the custom IoT/M2M operating portal can be deployed. The ServiceSync Services Platform is used to connect any wired or wireless device and to enable developers to quickly create powerful, value-added applications for end customers.</p>
        
        <h3>ServiceSync Client</h3>
        <p>Each wireless device or wirelessly attached asset requires a small agent, called ServiceSync Client, to support such things as event reporting, server messaging, asset data instrumentation, logging, etc. Currently the Client for Linux and Android is available, while it can be ported on the industry standard embedded OS. The Client provides API so that embedded IoT/M2M applications on the machines can be developed and deployed in timely manner.</p>
        
        <h3>ServiceSync Gateway</h3>
        <p>Each machine or sensor which equips only short-range networking connectivity requires ServiceSync Gateway in order for them to connect with the Server. The ServiceSync Gateway allows the IoT/M2M application developers to download and dynamically plug-in the custom IoT/M2M applications which manages those machines and sensors and interconnects those applications with the corresponding IoT/M2M applications on the remote side.</p>
        
        <h3>ServiceSync Developer Suite</h3>
        <p>Developer Suite is a toolset supporting embedded and server application development. The Embedded Developer Suite is tightly integrated with the Client and Gateway. Embedded application development can be in C, Java or LUA*. The Application Developer Suite is integrated with the Services Platform web services APIs and the Operating Portal, supporting web UI and external system integration to tailor the total enterprise SOA based IoT/M2M system.</p>
