        <h1>App Design in MOAT IoT</h1>
        <p>Data models are the fundamentals in MOAT IoT paradigm as well as a general application.<br />
          Therefore, it is very important for the MOAT IoT application development to identify Data Models commonly shared between Web App and Device App.
          In order for you to apply MOAT IoT, there are several steps to do.
        <ol>
          <li>Create Data Models</li>
          <li>Find Data Models shared between Web App and Device App</li>
          <li>Apply MOAT IoT Naming Convention to them</li>
        </ol>
        Note that MOAT IoT doesn't provide any methodology to create data models. Through your own way of development, the introduced models are the ones to be applied for MOAT IoT.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Create Data Models</h3>
        <p>We assume you will create data models of your application so to design the UI or the database schema.<br />
          MOAT IoT requires some of your data models so that the entire stack of MOAT IoT application can share the structures of the models.<br />
          Suppose we are about to create a heart rate monitoring app. Here is a class diagram.</p>
        
        <h3>Find Data Models used in both Web App and Device App</h3>
        <p>Device App is sometimes just a collection of sensors such as electric current/voltage or temperature. In such case, you can easily specify the data models as these are just representing the sensors.<br />
          For Smartphone App, you may need more complicated process, designing UI, drawing models then find the shared ones.<br />
          Whatever your application is, through these kind of processes, the primary data models for MOAT IoT application are discovered.</p>
        
        <h3>Apply MOAT IoT Naming Convention</h3>
        <p>What do you need to do next?<br />
          That is to provide the concrete representations corresponding to the data models.<br />
          Data models in MOAT IoT have multiple representations per single data model. </p>

          <p><i>fig. A single data model has multiple representations applied to each application stack.</i></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>MOAT IoT Data Model Name Convention</h3>
        <p>There are 5 elements to identify Data models, their attributes and their operations.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Application ID<br />
            is a UUID value provided by MOAT IoT runtime on the application registration.<br />
            e.g.11e90c60-cda1-11e1-9b23-0800200c9a66</li>
          <br />
          <li>Package ID<br />
            is a string identifier by an application developer.<br />
            Alphabet, numeric, hyphen '-', and underscore character '_' are acceptable. The first character of the ID should be an alphabet character.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Version<br />
            is a version identifier to identify the revision of the same package ID.<br />
            Alphabet, numeric, underscore character '_', dot '.' and hyphen '-' are acceptable.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Data Model Type<br />
            Alphabet, numeric and underscore character '_' are acceptable. The first character of the ID should be a capitalized character and follow CamelCase.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Attribute/Command Type<br />
            is an attribute name or a command name of the model.<br />
            Alphabet, numeric and underscore character '_' are acceptable.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example,</p>
        
        <h3>REST API URI</h3>
        <p>Data models can be represented in URI form so that Web apps are able to access to the models.</p>
        
        <div id="JobServiceIdentifier"><h3>Job Service Identifier</h3></div>
        <p>Job Service Identifier (or Service Identifier) is a system wide global identifier representing a single unit of device control job request.<br />
          The identifier follows URN format starting with urn:moat prefix. For instance, suppose the following job service id; </p>
        <pre>urn:moat:485b593b-45ce-40e1-88e1-658fbf20e5fa:MyApp:alert-notificaton-request:1.0</pre>
        <p>As you can see, each element is separated with ':' character and 'urn:moat:' is always same. The next element '485b593b-45ce-40e1-88e1-658fbf20e5fa' to the prefix is an applicationId which contains one or more packages.<br />
          'MyApp' is a packageId which enables you to categorise models and scripts. 'alert-notification-request' is a service name, which identifies a MOAT js file to run. The js file name must follow <code>{:service_name}!{:version}.js</code>. The service name is case-sensitive, should be identical to the corresponding js file name. The value must be unique within a same packageId. The last part '1.0' is the version number of the definition. </p>
