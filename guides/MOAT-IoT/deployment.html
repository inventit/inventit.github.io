        <h1>Deployment</h1>
        <p>Let's start from the big picture.<br />
          Your service application will be deployed as follows.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h3>Web Apps</h3>
        <p>Your concrete service application goes here. SQL/NoSQL databases, application servers, or any other middleware related to your apps are there as well.<br />
          You can create and deploy such the web application on your own hosts or any cloud services such as <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://www.force.com/">Force.com</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/jp/elasticbeanstalk/">Amazon Elastic Beanstalk</a> or whatever you want.
          You already have one? No problem. You can modify it. <br />
          What you need is to write a code to interact with Remote Server. <a href="deployment/moat-rest.html">MOAT REST</a> offers that. </p>
        
        <h3>Remote Server</h3>
        <p>Your web application should be focused on your service and its functionalities.<br />
          How about the following functions? - Defining protocols between device and server? - Interacting devices securely? - Managing sessions between device and server?
          No, no, no, you don't, but our server does.<br />
          Instead, you just write a code, what you want devices to do. <a href="deployment/moat-js.html">MOAT js</a> offeres that. </p>
        
        <h3>Android Devices</h3>
        <p>Your service shall have an Android client with fancy UI/UX and backend logics in the device or to communicate with the web app.
          You may also have to consider the communication traffic, transient phone network connectivity, or more convenient push functionality than <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html">GCM</a>/<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/c2dm/">C2DM</a>.
          Here, you no longer have to care about the underlying system, either. - How to connect to server - Connection handling - Push functionality or whatever the client interacts with the Remote Server, they are provided. <a href="/references/moat-java-api-document.html">MOAT Android</a> offeres that. </p>
        <h3>OSGi Devices / Gateways</h3>
        <p>This is a client running on OSGi containers.<br />
          Do you already have your own bundles? - Great.<br />
          You can deploy and enhance them. <a href="/references/moat-java-api-document.html">MOAT OSGi Gateway</a> provides DmtAdmin(r4v4.2) and additional embedded libraries to allows you to integrate them with MOAT IoT. </p>
