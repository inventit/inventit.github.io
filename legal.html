        <p>Here we provide you the links to our legal terms and policies.</p>
        <p>Note that the cloud platform service (Inventit IoT Developer Network Development Sandbox Server) introduced here is still in beta and is expected for development and experimental uses. Therefore, the platform availability is very limited.</p>
        <p>We will separately release our commercial service and announce here in the website. The term of service and other policies described here are limited to the beta service.</p>
