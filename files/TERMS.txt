The “IIDN Services” means the services Inventit makes available through this website, including this website, the IIDN sandbox cloud computing platform, the API enabling you to access to the platform, and any other software or services offered by Inventit in connection to any of those.

1.2 In order to use the IIDN Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the IIDN Services. You understand and agree that Inventit will treat your use of the IIDN Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
