        </ul>
        <h1>Term of Service</h1>
        <p>Effective January 18, 2013</p>
        <h3>1. Your Agreement with Inventit Inc.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Your use of the Inventit Inc. service is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "Inventit" means Inventit Inc., located at 9F 4-4-7, Kojimachi, Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 102-0083, Japan, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the IIDN Service. "IIDN" means the name of this website, Inventit IoT Developer Network. The "IIDN Services" means the services Inventit makes available through this website, including this website, the IIDN sandbox cloud computing platform, the API enabling you to access to the platform, and any other software or services offered by Inventit in connection to any of those. </li><br />
          <li> In order to use the IIDN Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the IIDN Services. You understand and agree that Inventit will treat your use of the IIDN Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards. </li><br />
          <li> If you have entered into or enter into a master subscription agreement with Inventit MobiConnect (mobi-connect.net), that master subscription agreement shall not apply to IIDN Services, and IIDN Services shall not be considered a service or product or part of any service or product under such master subscription agreement, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Inventit MobiConnect. The IIDN Services are delivered from an infrastructure different from the infrastructure underlying other Inventit services, and any representations or commitments by Inventit MobiConnect regarding the security or availability of its services or products do not apply to IIDN Services. </li><br />
          <li> You may not use the IIDN Services if you are a person barred from receiving the IIDN Services under the laws of Japan or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the IIDN Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the IIDN Services are not intended for children under 13. </li><br />
          <li> You agree your purchases of IIDN Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Inventit or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>2. Your Account and Use of the IIDN Services</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the IIDN Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Inventit immediately. </li><br />
          <li> Your use of the IIDN Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software. </li><br />
          <li> You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the IIDN Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Inventit in connection with the IIDN Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Inventit, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the IIDN Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service). </li><br />
          <li> Your account has "hard" and "soft" usage limits, as further <a href="">りんくはるexplained here</a> (or such URL as Inventit may provide). The IIDN Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Inventit reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion, which may result in Inventit serving a "quota exceeded" page to you or users to whom you serve web pages via the IIDN Services ("End Users"). Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account. </li><br />
          <li> You may use the IIDN Services only to develop and run applications on the IIDN infrastructure. You may not access the IIDN Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Inventit or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the IIDN Services and the Inventit Services. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>3. Service Policies and Privacy</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> You agree to comply with the IIDN Acceptable Use Policy available at acceptable use policy (the "<a href="acceptable-use-policy.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>") which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time. </li><br />
          <li> The IIDN Services shall be subject to the <a href="privacy-policy.html">privacy policy</a> for the IIDN Services available at privacy policy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Inventit's privacy policies. </li><br />
          <li> You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Inventit. </li>
        </ol>

          <li> In the event that you become aware of any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy by an End User of Applications, you shall immediately terminate such end user's account on your Application. Inventit reserves the right to disable Applications in response to a violation or suspected violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. </li><br />
          <li> You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Inventit has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Application or any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the IIDN Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Inventit may suffer) by doing so. </li><br />

          <li> Except as provided in Section 8, Inventit acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content or Applications that you create, submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the IIDN Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Inventit, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Inventit has no obligation to do so on your behalf. </li>
        </ol>

          <li> You agree that if Inventit does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Inventit has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Inventit's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Inventit. </li><br />
          <li> Inventit shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances. </li><br />
