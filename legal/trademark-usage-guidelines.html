        <h1>Trademark Usage Guidelines</h1>
        <p>The following guidelines apply to the use of all Inventit Marks licensed pursuant to the Terms:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You must use the appropriate legend for the Mark: Â® for registered trademarks, TM for unregistered trademarks, and SM for unregistered service marks.</li><br />
          <li>You shall not use any Inventit Mark to disparage Inventit, its products or services, or in a manner which, in Inventit's reasonable judgment, may diminish or damage its goodwill in the Mark or imply endorsement by Inventit. You agree to cease all such uses upon written notification by Inventit. You agree not to take any action which might lead a third party to think Inventit's Mark is owned by you, or which might adversely impact Inventit's reputation. You shall at all times use the Inventit Marks in a manner consistent with trademark laws.</li><br />
          <li>You shall notify Inventit immediately of any improper, infringing, confusing or unauthorized use of Inventit's Marks of which you become aware.</li><br />
          <li>You shall not alter the appearance of any Inventit Mark or obscure such Mark in any way. Changing the color, font, or proportions of any Inventit Mark is prohibited.</li><br />
          <li>Questions concerning proper use of the Marks shall be directed to contact[AT]yourinventit.com.</li>
